</h3> Teaching felt like a natural extension of what I spent most of my time doing in undergrad – serving as a head TA for large undergraduate courses. I found teaching to be far more fulfilling than anything else I was exposed to in my undergraduate journey. It wasn't until the end of my junior year that I knew this was a possibility, however. <h3> Career Path </h3> By the start of my senior year of undergrad (Fall 2019), I had served as a teaching assistant (Graduate Student Instructor, or GSI, in Berkeley-speak) for five semesters, three of which were in an administrative+teaching role. At that point, I had also taught my own Discrete Mathematics course for two semesters through the DeCal program, which allows undergraduates to propose and teach their own courses under the supervision of a faculty sponsor. Around then, I started to become aware of the possibility of pursuing a teaching faculty position without a PhD and started to reach out to others who were in that role. The most crucial immediate step, though, was applying and getting into the MS program at Berkeley (which, like at many other institutions, was a 1 year addition to my undergrad degree). During my senior year I served as an administrative TA twice more, and served as a co-instructor for a regularly offered course the summer after (this seems to be a common theme amongst those who have followed this path). At the start of my MS I began to identify institutions and positions I wanted to apply to, and sent in all of my applications right around Thanksgiving. I did most of my interviews in the first half of Spring 2021, and decided on DS@UCSD towards the end of March. <h3> Recommendations to Others </h3> Two things.<br>1. Reach out and talk to as many people who came before you as you can. I benefitted immensely from chatting with others who went down this path; they helped with identifying if this was the right career path for me, giving me the "insider scoop" about the institutions they were at, helping me prepare for interviews, how to negotiate, etc. This site should help with this to an extent, but it's also important to build personal connections.<br>2. Don't be afraid to apply to jobs that say they require PhDs! I received multiple offers from positions that advertised that they required PhDs. At some institutions these requirements may be more strict than others, but don't limit your search. <h2> Position Details </h2> <h3> Contract/Tenure </h3> 2 year contract, "Continuing Lecturer" status after 6 years <br> <h3> Courses </h3> Undergraduate, lower division data science courses (so far, introductory programming+inference and intermediate practical data science). Can teach upper-div and MS level courses too. <br> <h3> Service </h3> Remains to be seen; nothing is required but plan on getting involved somehow. <br> <h3> Research </h3> Trying to get more involved in CS and DS Ed research.
