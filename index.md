# Overview

Hello!!! Welcome to the site!

This site is designed to act as a resource so people can learn more about teaching Computer Science at the unversity level, but with no PhD!


We welcome those who are already in academia (and considering hiring people without a PhD), Students considering a job in teaching, and people who have a master's and are looking into joining us!

To help serve our goals, we have information on:
- Schools who hire for teaching positions without requiring a PhD
- Schools that have Master's Degree Programs to help get people into teaching
- First-hand advice and information on some of us that are already teaching without a PhD!

People commonly assume that all university faculty have PhDs, but this is increasingly not true (at least not in Computer Science).
As enrollments in CS programs continue to grow, there has been a steady growth in teaching faculty positions especially as these institutitions acknowledge the fact that a PHD doesn't necessarily prepare you for being a teacher (though it can, depending on the PhD program). Some graduate expertise is still typically required, to show you have some mastery over the material, and so some places have settled on accepting people with only a Master's degree. However, a Master's degree doesn't necessarily mean you will be a good teacher. Regardless of what degree you have, the things that stand out most to hiring committees are experience and interest in teaching.

{: .warning }
We will try to keep track of who is hiring every year, but this is something that is done on a volunteer basis. It may take a week or so between a posting being announced and it gets added to the website.
If you would like to add your institution, please feel free to reach out to us below!

Please feel free to reach out to us if you have a question!
