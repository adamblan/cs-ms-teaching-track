- institution: University of Pennsylvania
  location: Philadelphia, PA, USA
  notes:
    - Normal Teaching Assistant pay & process for MS students as undergraduates. (~$16/hr but goes up $1/hr or so if you are a head TA)
    - Opportunity to be instructor of a "mini course" during the year, you get better pay than being a teaching assistant. (https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis19x/)
    - Possibility for PhD and some MS students to teach or co-teach a full course in Fall or Spring Semester. Get paid about enough to cover tuition for that semester.
    - Summer Instructor positions are also possible things
- institution: Stanford
  location: Palo Alto, CA, USA
  notes:
    - Teaching Assistant possitions (called course assistants or CA) available
    - Seems some MS students are guaranteed funding by being a CA when they are accepted to graduate school.
    - Summer instructor/co-instructor positions available and supported
- institution: University of California, Berkeley
  location: Berkeley, CA, USA
  notes:
    - Can TA (called Graduate Student Instructors or GSIs) or Head TA massive courses
    - Pay seems to be around $3k a month for 10-20 hours a week, but varies a little year to year and based on how much experience you have.
    - MS Students can get in-state tuition covered, which includes all the fees for CA folks doing a "research oriented" MS. "Professional Masters" programs (like berkeleyâ€™s M.Eng or Stats MS, MIMS/MIDS in the iSchool) have an additional set of fees.
    - Summer instructor positions are quite possible and supported. Great pay (~$20k). Can teach the summer that you graduate.
    - Getting a TA role as an MS students can be hard unless you have a discussion with a faculty member about it. This is due to costs of having an MS teaching assistant instead of an undergraduate.
    - Has the DeCal program which lets all UC Berkeley students (including undergrad) create and teach courses even during the school year. Typically does not have much mentoring, nor count towards a degree. No payment for this either. Could be better (or as good) to just be an experienced Head TA.
- institution: University of Washington, Seattle
  location: Seattle, WA, USA
  notes:
    - Only available really if you are doing your BS there already. This is part of their combined "BS/MS" program
    - If you are intersted in being a middle or high school teaching in Washington state, they also have the step-cs program which seems able to fund its students and open to those who did their bachelor degree outside UW https://www.computinged.uw.edu/stepcs/
    - Should have tuition waived and stipend every quarter you teach/TA
    - Has a system to support instructor opportunities over the summer for most of their core courses.
- institution: University of Illinois Chicago
  location: Chicago, IL, USA
  notes:
    - Being a teaching assistant is possible, but priority is given to PhD students
    - Being a TA gets a stipend and tuition waived.
    - Seemingly no formal instructor opportunities, even over summer. Technically possible and has happened, but may have been a special circumstance.
    - At time of writing (August 2024) has ~2-3 students who are being prepared to be instructors at UIC itself
