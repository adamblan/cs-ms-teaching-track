  notes:
    - Normal Teaching Assistant pay & process for MS students as undergraduates. (~$16/hr but goes up $1/hr or so if you are a head TA)
    - Opportunity to be instructor of a "mini course" during the year, you get better pay than being a teaching assistant. (https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis19x/)
    - Possibility for PhD and some MS students to teach or co-teach a full course in Fall or Spring Semester. Get paid about enough to cover tuition for that semester.
    - Summer Instructor positions are also possible things
- institution: Stanford
  location: Palo Alto, CA, USA
  notes:
    - Teaching Assistant possitions (called course assistants or CA) available
    - Seems some MS students are guaranteed funding by being a CA when they are accepted to graduate school.
    - Summer instructor/co-instructor positions available and supported

  notes:
    - Being a teaching assistant is possible, but priority is given to PhD students
    - Being a TA gets a stipend and tuition waived.
    - Seemingly no formal instructor opportunities, even over summer. Technically possible and has happened, but may have been a special circumstance.
    - At time of writing (August 2024) has ~2-3 students who are being prepared to be instructors at UIC itself
