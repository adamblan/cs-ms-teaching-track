  education: MS in Computer Science (2019), UC Berkeley<br>BA in Computer Science and Cognitive Science (2018), UC Berkeley
  motivation: The most empowering experience I had in college was through helping other students in my first CS course. The course made space for students to help each other, and I benefited from and contributed to its community of learners. It's what made me consider myself a computer scientist having only taken a single course. But it's also through precisely these social interactions—entangled with race, gender, ability, and other social characteristics—that computer science culture denies validation, identity, and even existence to students. My work as a teacher-researcher-activist explores this question of how we can create more equitable, inclusive, student- and community-centered CS education.
  careerpath: I grew up in San Ramon, California, a not-so-small-anymore suburb of the San Francisco Bay Area. Surrounded by a large community of other Asian Americans, I was rarely marginalized or challenged by social issues because I assimilated values that stereotypically characterize Asian Americans (e.g. model minority myth). My formal education as a student through university reinforced these views, reflecting the dominant computing culture that defined computing as mostly abstracted from the world.  But my interest in teaching quickly raised questions about the purposes and end goals of education as a project that could either center or marginalize equity. In my work as an undergraduate and graduate TA, I studied how the design of our CS learning environments could shape student outcomes and identities through how they emphasized student hierarchies, exacerbated inequities in prior knowledge, or decentered students in the learning process. Through hundreds of hours observing students' real experiences with CS education, I identified dozens of ways that courses, course infrastructures, and learning environments normalize and reflect instructor values about social order, social classification, and social relations.  Today, my mission is to research, design, and disseminate pedagogies, curricula, and ways of living that realize computing education's possibility as a force for human liberation rather than human domination.
  recommendations: Sasha Costanza-Chock echoes W.E.B. Du Bois when she asks, "Is the ultimate object to make people good coders, or to make coders good people?" Computing education is a sociopolitical project that affects all of our lives, involves all of our values, and determines our collective hopes for the future. And yet it is also a personal project that is about community, connection, and identity. In both these ways, teachers shape the imaginations and possibilities of the people we teach, how each person will spend their 80,000 career hours, and what they ultimately see in themselves. To realize a more caring and just future, we must work toward equity at all levels that engages students in all these ways, which starts with an eagerness to listen, learn, and act toward these ends.
  contract: 3 year contract
  courses: Data Structures and Algorithms, Introductory Programming, Data Science
  service: Mandatory activities mostly center on committee service assignments. I've served on admissions, faculty recruiting, and diversity. This year, I'm also chairing a committee. On my own time, I organize other activities to sustain ComputingEd@UW, organize student travel to SIGCSE TS (the largest annual computing education conference), and lead small seminars around computing education.
  research: Centering ethics, identity, and political vision to realize more equitable computing education (see personal website linked above).

  institution: University of California, San Diego

  education: BS (2020) and MS (2021) in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, UC Berkeley
  motivation: Teaching felt like a natural extension of what I spent most of my time doing in undergrad – serving as a head TA for large undergraduate courses. I found teaching to be far more fulfilling than anything else I was exposed to in my undergraduate journey. It wasn't until the end of my junior year that I knew this was a possibility, however.
  careerpath: By the start of my senior year of undergrad (Fall 2019), I had served as a teaching assistant (Graduate Student Instructor, or GSI, in Berkeley-speak) for five semesters, three of which were in an administrative+teaching role. At that point, I had also taught my own Discrete Mathematics course for two semesters through the DeCal program, which allows undergraduates to propose and teach their own courses under the supervision of a faculty sponsor.  Around then, I started to become aware of the possibility of pursuing a teaching faculty position without a PhD and started to reach out to others who were in that role. The most crucial immediate step, though, was applying and getting into the MS program at Berkeley (which, like at many other institutions, was a 1 year addition to my undergrad degree).  During my senior year I served as an administrative TA twice more, and served as a co-instructor for a regularly offered course the summer after (this seems to be a common theme amongst those who have followed this path). At the start of my MS I began to identify institutions and positions I wanted to apply to, and sent in all of my applications right around Thanksgiving.  I did most of my interviews in the first half of Spring 2021, and decided on DS@UCSD towards the end of March.
  recommendations: Two things.<br>1. Reach out and talk to as many people who came before you as you can. I benefitted immensely from chatting with others who went down this path; they helped with identifying if this was the right career path for me, giving me the "insider scoop" about the institutions they were at, helping me prepare for interviews, how to negotiate, etc. This site should help with this to an extent, but it's also important to build personal connections.<br>2. Don't be afraid to apply to jobs that say they require PhDs! I received multiple offers from positions that advertised that they required PhDs. At some institutions these requirements may be more strict than others, but don't limit your search.
  contract: 2 year contract, "Continuing Lecturer" status after 6 years
  courses: Undergraduate, lower division data science courses (so far, introductory programming+inference and intermediate practical data science). Can teach upper-div and MS level courses too.
  service: Remains to be seen; nothing is required but plan on getting involved somehow.
  research: Trying to get more involved in CS and DS Ed research. See personal website for links to existing work on curriculum development and reflection.
