recommendation: Find your niche outside of core programming courses. Even if you don't end up teaching there, a confident proposal about your area of expertise is very helpful.
developed-interest: Getting the opportunity to TA for and then fully teach a Python minicourse in undergrad.
career-path: I TA'd for a Python mini-course as an undergraduate. The course was part of a larger system of courses taught by students of all levels (PhD through undergraduate) mentored by Swapneel Sheth and Joe Devietti. After a few semesters, Swap & Joe invited me to apply for the instructor role, and after two tries, they selected me to teach the course. I did this for three semesters, enjoying it more and more each time. <br><br>After undergrad, I got my Master's as a way to "buy time" deciding between teaching, research, or industry. I spent a full year without any meaningful teaching experiences and I noticed feeling unfulfilled. Over the following summer, I worked as a TA for the Lede Program in Data Journalism at Columbia and spent all day doing really exciting teaching with a great group of students, proving to myself that teaching is what I wanted to do. <br><br>The following Fall, I applied semi-widely for teaching jobs. Penn made me an early and compelling offer. Enticed by the exciting prospect (and wary of the oncoming pandemic's impact on the remainder of my job search), I accepted the offer and never looked back! I've had an excellent four years working as a Lecturer and I expect to be promoted to Senior Lecturer in Fall '24.
