recommendation: Ask questions, and find your people. I felt out of place and like an imposter when I overheard other faculty members discussing more Ph.D.-related things like grants, advising grad students, and managing labs. I didn't always have the full context of their discussions, but felt nervous to reveal that I lacked this knowledge or experience. But they hired you, they're familiar with your background, and you bring a ton of knowledge and experience to the table that they don't have! As you get to know academia and your specific institution, ask questions and find your people (who you can also ask questions). Every institution will have a tagline, but the people you connect with can provide advice, background, and insights that will serve you well as you continue! 
developed-interest: I became a TA during my undergrad, and quickly realized how much I enjoyed teaching when I was looking forward to TA work like grading after completing my own coursework. My connections with students and helping them realize that they *could* be successful in CS were the most fulfilling for me (as I had originally taken this same course expecting to do poorly and dislike CS). 
academic-path: I began TAing for the CS 1 course in my undergrad, and I TAed every quarter afterwards (with the exception of a few summers when I had internships). After a few quarters, I took on more responsibilities and moved into leadership roles where I had more insight into course policy, management, and pedagogical choices. As a BS/MS student, I had the opportunity to teach the course on my own, which reassured my interest and enjoyment of teaching full courses. After graduation, I went to into industry for a while (Microsoft), but began teaching on the side after being asked to cover some courses that didn't have instructors, and was unsurprised when I fell back into the pattern of looking forward to doing work for the courses after finishing my day at Microsoft. I taught on the side of being a SWE for about a year before I made the decision to fully commit to teaching, and applied to become an Assistant Teaching Professor.
