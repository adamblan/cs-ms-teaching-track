recommendation: Reach out and ask for help! You're lucky enough to be considering this at a time when there are a fair amount of people who have trod this path before (many on this website) -- their experiences are all going to be varied and different, but one thing I think most of us are very happy to do is to help others to follow the same path, whether that's figuring out what that path looks like for you, where you need to go, or how to apply for jobs. There are also likely (depending where you're at) people at your institution who will work with you to make sure you're getting experience teaching your own courses or taking on responsibility in courses so that you can see what that feels like for yourself and get the kind of experiences to help you land a job.
developed-interest: My interest was sparked through TAing as an undergrad, and then slowly being introduced to more leadership roles and getting more involved in the larger cs education research at my university.
academic-path: As an undergrad at UW, I got my start as an undergraduate TA for our intro CS courses. I immediately found that it was something I deeply enjoyed, and became more and more interested in the course design and pedagogy decisions that went into creating the classes I was teaching. My head TA at the time helped guide me through taking on more responsibility within the course and recommended I join a CS Ed reading group. That was what got me more involved in the CS Ed community at my university, and interacting with teaching faculty every week began to show me what being a teaching faculty member looked like. At the same time, I had been doing the CS student thing, doing software engineering internships every summer, and each experience felt very hollow and unsatisfying for me, which helped me realize that the thing I had loved most about CS was teaching it.<br> In my entire undergrad, I only ever taught for people without PhDs, so it wasn't a huge realization for me that I could do this job without getting a PhD; I just had to figure out what I did need to do, and how to do it. By my senior year, I was 100% sure that my goal was to become teaching faculty.That resulted in me doing a combined BS/MS program at UW to get my MS in Computer Science, which also gave me time and experience leading my own classes. In my last year, I went on the job market and ended up at the University of Illinois Chicago, which is where I'm at now, starting my career in full. I'm only just finishing my first year, so I don't have much else to say right now!
