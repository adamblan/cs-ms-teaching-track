role: Teaching Assistant Professor
department: Information Science
institution: University of Colorado, Boulder
term-type: Sem

education: I completed an undergraduate degree in Information Systems from the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, before transitioning to industry. Later, I earned an MS in Information and Communication Technology for Development from the University of Colorado, Boulder, where I continued as teaching faculty in creative technologies. I further complemented these qualifications with an MFA in Digital Arts from Emily Carr University of Art + Design in Vancouver, BC, completed during the pandemic.<br><br>While I do not have a strong enough interest in pursuing doctoral studies, I maintain a creative practice that parallels traditional research in several respects. I consider the field of education—specifically learning science—to be where I have the most applied knowledge.
affiliations: Consulting, artist
contract-length: 3yr appointment.  Currently on my 2nd.
term-load: 2-4
courses: Comp and Society.  Computational Reasoning.  Tech Ethics. Capstone.  Digital Humanities.  Courses run the gamut, ranging from intro to upper-division and graduate seminars.
department-service: Advising, committees, lite administrative work
college-service: Minimal.  Participation in college/institutional events + occasional collaboration.  
research:  N/A (I maintain a creative practice that is similar, but not a part of my contractual obligations)
recommendation: Make peace with precarity...and develop good relationships within the department.  Be collegial and confident.
developed-interest: First taught in South Korea as an English Instructor and the experience always stuck with me.  
academic-path: Might return to this at a later time...but in short, was asked to adjunct at CU after my MS.  After one year, I was appointed to full-time instructor.  I maintained that position for several years.  Original dept. did not renew my contract (in truth, it was an interesting dept with high turn-over). I had made contacts across campus and developed a good reputation as an educator and pivoted to Info Science.  I began the process of adjunctification again and was on path towards a full-time appointment when pandemic hit and that line was closed.  I decided to move to Vancouver, BC to pursue an MFA in digital arts. Was lucky enough to continue adjuncting remotely while there and, upon complete of my MFA, was offered the full-time post once more.<br><br>It's been circuitous and, at times, frustrating, but I've found an amazing department that treats me as a valued member, a colleague, and a friend.  Wish it happened sooner, but I landed in the right spot.
