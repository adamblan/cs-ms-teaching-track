research: Pedagogical research; contributed to Central Coast Data Science Partnership, developing data science curriculum and mentoring students https://centralcoastdatascience.org/
recommendation: I liked teaching part-time first to see if I actually enjoyed teaching. And I liked teaching at different types of institutions (city college, private undergraduate college, and research university) to experience the differences first-hand. 
developed-interest: I always gravitated toward tutoring and education. I was passionate about encouraging others in their math education and loved reframing concepts in ways that would motivate the individual. 
career-path: After grading with a BS in Mathematical Sciences at UC Santa Barbara, I volunteered for a year in Chicago with AmeriCorps, working in a ninth-grade math classroom. I then came back to UC Santa Barbara and worked in IT for 8 years. While I worked, I got my MS in Applied Math at University of Washington online. After receiving my master's, I taught part-time at Santa Barbara City College and Westmont while still working in IT, before I transitioned to teaching full-time at UC Santa Barbara in the Computer Science department and the Statistics & Applied Probability department.
