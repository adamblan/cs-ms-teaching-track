research:
recommendation: I think when people are first considering becoming teaching faculty without a PhD (or industry experience) their concern is about whether they are “qualified” to be faculty. I had the same feelings but did not let it stop me. Many other people I knew decided to go to industry and part of their reasoning was so that they could learn more and be better qualified.<br><br>I reject that you need either a PhD or industry experience to be great CS teaching track faculty. You will continue to learn as faculty, and you do not need to go to industry or finish a PhD to learn anything you would teach. Can those experiences help? Yes, but so will the extra time you have spent as faculty instead of doing those other things. Those genuinely interested in industry or a PhD should still do it, but it is not at all a required experience, instead I see it as a “different” experience.
developed-interest: I came to the conclusion I wanted to teach as a full-time job during my first (and only) summer internship. I was already interested in teaching and did a lot, but I decided to try industry to see if I would like it. I found myself coming up with assignments and exam problems when I had nothing else to do at work. Two months in I woke up and thought "I can't do this for the next 40 years of my life" but with a lot more profanity. I returned to teaching and never looked back :)
academic-path: I always liked helping people and so I tutored some math and physics in high school. Once at University, I became a TA and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I got involved more with the teaching community through TA-ing a lot of times across many courses, taking CS education seminars, and getting to know the instructors. As I continued to TA, I was granted the opportunity to try giving one of the lectures for the course I was a TA for. It was very stressful but it went well. I eventually got the opportunity to teach over the summer (2020, so it was on Zoom due to COVID). The following fall, I applied for teaching positions and ended up at the University of Pennsylvania, where I have been since August  2021.
