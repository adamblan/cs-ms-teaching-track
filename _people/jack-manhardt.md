recommendation: You will need (preferably multiple) people at your target institution who can bring your application to the faculty and vouch for your teaching ability. Applying to the same institution where you completed your masters is your best shot, but otherwise network, network, network. Some faculty will advocate for taking a chance on a M.S. applicant they know and trust over a stranger with a PhD, but others are sadly not so open-minded yet and you'll need someone on your side to convince them.
developed-interest: During my undergrad, I had some very excellent and some very bad teachers. It struck me that teachers have the potential to impact (for better or worse) the lives and trajectories of hundreds of students every semester. I began to see it as an important responsibility and a rewarding contribution to society at large.
academic-path: I began in undergrad by forming connections to faculty members that I respected, performing grading work and paying close attention to their approach to teaching. Going after student leadership roles helped make me at least known to as many faculty as possible. <br><br>I did my masters at the same institution, using my connections with the undergrad faculty to find a graduate faculty advisor. I completed a masters thesis to get a better understanding of the academic world despite being mostly uninterested in research. At my institution, GTAs are sometimes asked to deliver lectures under the guidance of a coordinator. I expressed my interest in this to my faculty connections, and they helped place me in a teaching role. I devoted myself to this position, trying my best to leave a record of good instruction. After a while I was allowed to teach without coordination over the Summer, which I used as an opportunity to re-design/improve the course to demonstrate my ability to contribute to the curriculum.<br><br>After completing my masters, I applied to the same institution for a faculty teaching role, making sure to highlight my familiarity with the undergrad program, my personal connection to the student body, and my record of strong teaching performance in the courses I had assisted with. Despite this, there were many doubts among the faculty about my application. The faculty that I knew and worked with personally were likely key advocates.
