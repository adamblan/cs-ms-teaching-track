role: Assistant Teaching Professor
department: Computer Science and Engineering
institution: University of Washington
term-type: Qtr
email: kevinl@cs.uw.edu
website: https://kevinl.info
education: MS in Computer Science (2019), UC Berkeley<br>BA in Computer Science and Cognitive Science (2018), UC Berkeley
affiliations: 
contract-length: 3 years
term-load: 1-2
courses: Data Structures and Algorithms, Introductory Programming, Data Science
department-service: Mandatory activities mostly center on committee service assignments. I've served on admissions, faculty recruiting, and diversity. This year, I'm also chairing a committee. On my own time, I organize other activities to sustain ComputingEd@UW, organize student travel to SIGCSE TS (the largest annual computing education conference), and lead small seminars around computing education.
college-service: Committee service (by choice)
research: Centering ethics, identity, and political vision to realize more equitable computing education. https://kevinl.info
recommendation: Sasha Costanza-Chock echoes W.E.B. Du Bois when she asks, "Is the ultimate object to make people good coders, or to make coders good people?" Computing education is a sociopolitical project that affects all of our lives, involves all of our values, and determines our collective hopes for the future. And yet it is also a personal project that is about community, connection, and identity. In both these ways, teachers shape the imaginations and possibilities of the people we teach, how each person will spend their 80,000 career hours, and what they ultimately see in themselves. To realize a more caring and just future, we must work toward equity at all levels that engages students in all these ways, which starts with an eagerness to listen, learn, and act toward these ends.
developed-interest: The most empowering experience I had in college was through helping other students in my first CS course. The course made space for students to help each other, and I benefited from and contributed to its community of learners. It's what made me consider myself a computer scientist having only taken a single course. But it's also through precisely these social interactions—entangled with race, gender, ability, and other social characteristics—that computer science culture denies validation, identity, and even existence to students. My work as a teacher-researcher-activist explores this question of how we can create more equitable, inclusive, student- and community-centered CS education.
academic-path: I grew up in San Ramon, California, a not-so-small-anymore suburb of the San Francisco Bay Area. Surrounded by a large community of other Asian Americans, I was rarely marginalized or challenged by social issues because I assimilated values that stereotypically characterize Asian Americans (e.g. model minority myth). My formal education as a student through university reinforced these views, reflecting the dominant computing culture that defined computing as mostly abstracted from the world. <br><br>But my interest in teaching quickly raised questions about the purposes and end goals of education as a project that could either center or marginalize equity. In my work as an undergraduate and graduate TA, I studied how the design of our CS learning environments could shape student outcomes and identities through how they emphasized student hierarchies, exacerbated inequities in prior knowledge, or decentered students in the learning process. Through hundreds of hours observing students' real experiences with CS education, I identified dozens of ways that courses, course infrastructures, and learning environments normalize and reflect instructor values about social order, social classification, and social relations.<br><br>Today, my mission is to research, design, and disseminate pedagogies, curricula, and ways of living that realize computing education's possibility as a force for human liberation rather than human domination.
